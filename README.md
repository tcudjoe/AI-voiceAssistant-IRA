# AI voice assistant IRA
IRA (pronounced Ir-ruh) is an Artificial Intelligence voice assistant which will have Machine Learning implented in it.

IRA started as an idea that was lingering in my head for quite some time. After using Siri on a daily basis, I wanted to create my own 'Siri'. After doing some research about home assistants, home automation and voice assistants, I decided to dive into the deep and just start coding.

*I have not decided yet if I want Ira to be open to the public. So for now, Ira is only for me and my loved ones own home use.*

IRA will be able to take commands and carry those commands out for use in the house. Ira will run on raspberry pi's troughout the house with microphones and motion sensors attached to them. The motion sensors will be used to detect in which room the user is so that the raspberry pi in that room is the only one that will respond and listen. All the raspberry pi's will be connected to a local server created with flask so users can also communicate with Ira from outside of the house.


## Commands Ira will be able to take:
    - Ira will be able to tell the current time
    - Ira will be able to tell the current date
    - Ira will be able to controle lights (I will be using Philips Hue)
    - Ira will be able to look up information on Google
    - Ira will be able to calculate any given equation
    - Ira will be able to controle a calender (I will be using google calender)
    - Ira will be able to use facial recognition to open front door
    - Ira will be able to carry out protocls (With protocols is meant that Ira can carry out multiple commands in one cluster)
    - Ira will be able to controle Spotify
    - Ira will be able to recocgnize voices for seperate people
    - Ira will be able to controle alarms
    - Ira will be able to controle temperature (No alternative chosen yet)
    - Ira will be able to tell the weather forecast
    - Ira will be able to tell the highlighted news (No specific news source chosen yet)
    - Ira will be able to call contacts from phone

*This list may grow as time goes on*

Thank you for taking a look at my project!
