#AI voice assistant IRA
IRA (pronounced Eira) is an Artificial Intelligence voice assistant for the pc.

IRA is a long term project that I have been wanting to build for a good while. IRA will be a project of mine that will be used for in my portfolio. 
This means that IRA will never really be finished but will only get updates.

IRA is also not a product for the public. IRA is, and will always be (unless my mind has been changed), for my own home use.

IRA will be able to:
    - tell the current time (feature added: August 2021)
    - tell todays date (feature added: August 2021)
    - turn lights on and off (feature added: ???)
    - dim lights (if dimmable (feature added: ???))
    - look up statements the user gives on Google (feature added: August 2021)
    - look up statements the user gives on Wikipedia (feature added: August 2021)
    - be used as a calculator
    - do much more things that will be stated here when added.

Thank you for taking a look at my project!
